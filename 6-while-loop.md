# The While Loop

You’re doing great! We’re going to teach you about a different type of loop: the ```while``` loop. To start, let’s convert a ```for``` loop into a ```while``` loop:

```
// a for loop to print 1, 2, 3
for (let counterOne = 1; counterOne < 4; counterOne++) {
  console.log(counterOne);
{

// a while loop to print 1, 2, 3
let counterTwo = 1;
while (counterTwo < 4) {
  console.log(counterTwo);
  counterTwo++;

}
```
Let’s break down what’s happening with our ```while``` loop syntax:

  - The ```counterTwo``` variable is declared before the loop. We can access it inside our ```while``` loop since it’s in the
global scope.
  - We start our loop with the keyword ```while``` followed by our stopping condition, or test condition. This will be
evaluated before each round of the loop. While the condition evaluates to true , the block will continue to run.
Once it evaluates to false the loop will stop.
  - Next, we have our loop’s code block which prints ```counterTwo``` to the console and increments ```counterTwo``` .

What would happen if we didn’t increment ```counterTwo``` inside our block? 
  - If we didn’t include this, ```counterTwo``` would always have its initial value, ```1``` . That would mean the testing condition ```counterTwo < 4``` would always evaluate to true and our loop would never stop running! 
    - This is called an infinite loop and it’s something we always want to avoid. 
    - Infinite loops can take up all of your computer’s processing power potentially freezing your computer.

So you may be wondering when to use a ```while``` loop! The syntax of a ```for``` loop is ideal when we know how many times the loop should run, but we don’t always know this in advance. Think of eating like a ```while``` loop: when you
start taking bites, you don’t know the exact number you’ll need to become full. Rather you’ll eat while you’re hungry.
  - In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, ```while``` loops are the best choice.
