In this hands-on tutorial, you will learn how to write cleaner code with loops. You will know:


  - Loops perform repetitive actions so we don’t have to code the process manually every time.
  - How to write ```for``` loops with an iterator variable that increments or decrements
  - How to use a ```for``` loop to iterate through an array
  - A nested ```for``` loop is a loop inside another loop
  - ```while``` loops allow for different types of stopping conditions
  - Stopping conditions are crucial for avoiding infinite loops.
  - ```do...while``` loops run code at least once— only checking the stopping condition after the first execution
  - The ```break``` keyword allows programs to leave a loop during the execution of its block
