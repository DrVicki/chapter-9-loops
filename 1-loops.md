# Loops

A loop is a programming tool which repeats a set of instructions until a specified condition, called a stopping condition is
reached. 

  - As a programmer, you’ll find you rely on loops all the time! You’ll hear the generic term **iterate** when
referring to loops; iterate simply means “to repeat”.

When we need to reuse a task in our code, we often bundle the action in a function. 
  - Similarly, when we see a process has to repeat multiple times in a row, we write a loop. 
  - Loops allow us to create efficient code which automates processes to make scalable, manageable programs.

As illustrated in the diagram, loops iterate or repeat an action until a specific condition is met. 
  - When the condition is
met, the loop stops and the computer moves on to the next part of the program.
